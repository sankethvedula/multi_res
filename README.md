# MRCNN
Multi Resolutional Convolutional Neural Network approach to increase the Video Frame Rate

Observations:
- There's a bit of smoothness in the images. Should be resolved.
  - The skip connection might help (done) - It works

To-Do-List:
- Test the model by giving low sample data as input and check the results
- Momentum
- Include a skip connection (HIGH PRIORITY) (Done)
- Train with bigger datasets (currently 20k as training)
- Try different optimizers (Done)
- Integrate Logger for the errors (done)
- Include Validation module (done)
