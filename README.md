# MRCNN
Multi Resolutional Convolutional Neural Network approach to increase the Video Frame Rate

Observations:
- There's a bit of smoothness in the images. Should be resolved.
  - The skip connection might help

To-Do-List:
- Include a skip connection (HIGH PRIORITY)
- Train with bigger datasets (currently 20k as training)
- Try different optimizers
- Momentum
- Integrate Logger for the errors (done)
- Include Validation module (done)
